# Offline Page Implementation

## Issue
The Progressive Web App (PWA) service worker was expecting an `/offline` route that didn't exist, causing 404 errors when users went offline.

## Solution
Created a comprehensive offline page at `/app/offline/page.tsx` that provides:

### Features
- ✅ User-friendly offline message
- ✅ List of available offline features
- ✅ "Try Again" button to reload
- ✅ Home navigation link
- ✅ Helpful tips about offline functionality

### Technical Implementation
- **Client Component**: Uses `'use client'` directive for interactivity
- **Separate Layout**: Created `/app/offline/layout.tsx` for metadata
- **Service Worker Integration**: Updated cache version to v2 for proper invalidation
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes
- **Dark Mode Support**: Proper theming for light/dark modes

### Offline Capabilities
When users go offline, they can still:
- Read previously loaded Bible chapters
- View saved bookmarks
- Browse search history
- Navigate back to home page

## Build Status
✅ Successfully builds and deploys
✅ Returns 200 status code (was 404)
✅ Properly integrated with PWA service worker

## Cache Strategy
The service worker now properly caches the offline page and serves it when users lose connectivity, providing a seamless offline experience.
